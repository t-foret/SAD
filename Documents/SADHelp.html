beam-line</A>
</H3>
<PRE> A beam line is defined in the MAIN level by LINE command as:

   LINE a = ( [n1*][-]l1 [ [n2*]l2 ...] ) [b = ( ... )];

where l1, l2 are either an element or a line. n1, n2 are positive integers to repeat the same element. An optional negative sign in
 fromt of element means the negative orientation of the element of the line. A negative orientation of a line is inherited by its e
lements.
 The first element of a beam line must be a MARK element, if it is used by FFS, USE, VISIT.
 Please do not confuse the LINE command in the MAIN level with the LINE function in FFS.
 A beam line can be accessed within FFS via beam-line-functions as shown below.

BeamLine</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: BeamLine[e1, e2, ...];

where e1, e2 has a form of

   [ - ][ n* ] x ,

with x being one of

1) a name (either a symbol or a character string) of an element defined in MAIN.
2) a name (either a symbol or a character string) of a LINE defined in MAIN.
3) a BeamLine object.

An optional negative sign specifies the direction and a number n the repetition number in the same way as MAIN. A BeamLine object i
s automatically expanded to the lowest level whenever it is evaluated. Editing of BeamLine can be done using any List-handling func
tions such as Join, Insert, Delete, etc. of FFS.

 A BeamLine object can be used for FFS calculation when it is used as the
argument of USE or VISIT commands:

Examples:
1) USE BeamLine[IP,QF,QD]
2) aaa=ExtractBeamLine[];
   USE Join[aaa,-aaa]

 In these cases the new beam line becomes a new LINE in the MAIN level, with a name which is created automatically.

<H3><A NAME=L29>
command-syntax</A>
</H3>
<PRE>The command syntax in FFS is

     expression1 [param1..] [;] expression2..	

(1) The input is first evaluated as an expression. If the expression returns a Symbol with the same name as the expression itself, 
it is interpreted as an FFS command, otherwise the returned value is printed out unless it is Null.
(2) Each command takes succeeding its parameters if necessary. A command with indefinite number of parameters can be terminated by 
semicolon. Most commands terminate itself at the end of line.
(3) A line can be continued to the next line if a backslash is placed at the end of the line.
(4) An expression continues to the next line if it is not closed in the line.
(5) An exclamation mark comments out the rest of the line.	

Example: A command line

          QF* .1

means the set-value-of-element command as unless the symbol QF has been defined otherwise. If QF has been defines as a number, such
 as QF=2.5, the above command line is interpreted as Times[QF,.1] then returns .25 .
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME=L30>
components</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Components are the objects which consist the beam line. A component simulates an individual magnet, drift space, or rf-cavity.
 The parameters of a component is specified the values in the corresponding element with the same name as the component, which simu
lates a power supply. Many components can be attached to the same element. Parameters of each component may deviate from the corres
ponding element if machine errors are given.
   A component is specified with the form name[.order][{+-}offset], where name is the name of the component. The number order means
 the order-th component which belongs to name element, counted from the beginning of the line starting from 1. Offset is a positive
 or negative number to specify the downstream or upstream components from the given component. If order is omitted, the first eleme
nt is assumed, and if offset is omitted, zero is assumed. The order can be renumbererd by RENUMBER(RENUM).
   The end of line is specified by $$$. The first component can be specified by ^^^.
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME=L31>

CALCULATE(CAL)</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: (1) CALCULATE(CAL) [[NO]EXPAND]]
       (2) CALCULATE(CAL) matching-function1[-] [matching-function2[-]..]
 
(1) With no argument or with an option [NO]EXPAND, calculates the optics and the matching-functions using the current values of the
 components. It prints out the values of the matching-functions specified either by the matching-function-commands or the second us
age of CAL, as described below. If an option EXPAND is given, it expands the beam line before the calculation. If NOEXPAND is given
, it calculates without any expansion. The default behavior on EXPAND is controlled by the KEEPEXP flag.   FFS["CAL"] and FFS["GO"]
 returns the result as a list, whose format is

   {dp, kind, reslist, function-values},

where	

dp:        a list contains dp/p0 .
kind:      a list of kind of the orbit (usually 0, but 1 to 6 for the finite amplitude matching, see MatchingAmplitude).
reslist:   a list of {residual, xstab, ystab}, where	
       residual: matching residual,
       xstab:    True when the matrix is stable in X,
       ystab:    True when the matrix is stable in Y, for each orbit.

Above are lists with length nf (== number of orbits).

function-values: a list of length nc (== number of calculated items). Each element has the form:

       {component1, component2, function, list-of-values},

       where

       component1, component2: fit locations (see FIT).
       function: name of the function (see matching-function-commands).
       list-of-values: list of the value of the function for each orbit Length nf.
       The central orbit comes at the Floor[(n+1)/2]-th element.

(2) With matching-function names, sets the matching-functions at the current fit point to be printed out after calculation. If the 
matching-function is followed by a minus sign, it suppresses the print-out.

 List[a, b, c, ...] is represented as {a, b, c, ...}.
 A list is also used to represent a mathematical vector and matrices.
 Most of mathematical functions are operated at each element of a list.

 If a is zero, it takes the head of f.
 if a is negative, f[[a]] os equivalent to f[[Length[f] + 1 + a]].
 If a is a list of Reals {a1, a2, ...}, f[[a]] returns {f[[a1]], f[[a2]], ...}.
 If a is Null, f[[,b]] is returns {f[[1,a]], ..., f[[Length[f], b]]}.

<PRE> A function is defined by one of the following forms:

f[pat1 [,pat2...]] (:)= body;
f[pat1 [,pat2...]] ^(:)= body;
g/:f[pat1 [,pat2...]] (:)= body;

where pat1 [,pat2...] are patterns (including expressions).
 If UpSet(^=) or UpSetDelayed (^:=) is used, the definition is associated with the symbol in the first level of l.h.s.
 If TagSet(/:) is used, the definition is associated with the symbol on the left of /: .

 The patters can be an expression including constants. The definition with constant arguments can be accessed faster than searching
 a list, in general, so they are suitable for a data base. Definitions with constant arguments have higher priorities than with pat
terns.

, BY, NY, EY, EPY, LENG, the length and the value of the default-keyword of the component. Each line refers to the entrance of each
 component of the line. The end of the beam line has the name "$$$". The first component can be specified by "^^^".
   DISP suspends the output to the terminal at every 66 lines, asking (q_uit, c_ontinue, a_ll)?. The further output depends on the 
first character of the answer from the terminal input. This dialog is suppressed by specifying ALL.
   DISP does not calculate the functions to be displayed, so CALCULATE(CALC) or GO is necessary whenever values of components are u
pdated.

DRAW</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: DRAW [begin end] fun1 [fun2..] [& fun11 [fun12..]] [element-pattern]

draws a plot of optical functions in multi columns. It calls OpticsPlot internally. Available functions are all matching-functions 
(except LENG, TRX, TRY, GX, GY, GZ, CHI1, CHI2, CHI3) and additional functions. If functions are separated by ampersand (&), these 
are plotted in a separated window.
  Function name preceded by "R" and "D" refer the reference-optics and the difference, respectively.
  If begin- and end-components are specified, the plot region is limited between them. If the end-component comes earlier than the 
begin-components, it wraps the plot around the beam line.
  If the optional element-pattern is given, it draws the beam-line lattice with the labels for elements which match element-pattern
. If LAT is specified for element-pattern, the lattice is drawn without label.
 A character string assigned to TITLE is shown as the FrameLabel on the top of the plot.

<PRE>An element in FFS represents an object which has a unique name and several keywords with values. This simulates a power supply
 of a magnet. An element has one or more components, which correspond to individual magnets in a beam line. Each component may have
 different values from the values of the corresponding element. This simulates the machine error which varies magnet to magnet
   The value of an element can be saved to or recovered from the element-save-buffer by SAVE or RESET commands. Different beam line
s can share the same element, and their values can be different to each other, but they have the common element-save-buffer. Theref
ore the value of an element can be transferred between beam lines by SAVE and RESET command through the element-save-buffer.
   An element is created only in SAD MAIN level. In the definition, if a keyword is omitted, the previous definition is unchanged. 
All keywords have the default value zero. In FFS, it is only possible to change their values.

If K1 is nonzero, the effects from E1 and E2 are approximated by thin
quadrupoles. Then the body is subdivided into

   1 + floor(sqrt(abs(K1 L')/(12 10^-5 EPS)))

pieces (EPS = 1 is used when EPS = 0), and the bend-body transformation above is done for each piece and the kick from K1 is applie
d alternatively. In FFS optics and Emittance calculations, or when the synchrotron radiation is turned on, the same algorithm as K1

nly) The non-relativistic corrections

     (VOLT+DVOLT)*(2 Pi FREQ/c)^2/(gamma beta)^2/4 are

automatically added to V20 and V02, respectively. The Lorentz factor is evaluated as inverse of average of 1/(beta gamma) at the en
trance and the exit.
   CAVI includes the edge effect at the lowest order, given by a Hamiltonian at the entrance edge at s0:

   Hf = - (e (VOLT+DVOLT)/L)(Sin(omega t - dphi) + Sin(dphi) - offset) (x^2+y^2)/4 delta(s-s0)
 where dphi and offset are determined by the cavity phase and the radiation loss, which is nonzero only in the case of NORAD. The s
ign flips at the exit. This Hamiltonian should be consistent with what Kiyoshi Kubo derived.

Note that these transformationis are NOT the inverse to each other.

   To use this element, you have to calculate the values of those parameters carefully. DISP G may help you but there is no automat
ic way to get them. You may also have to be careful when you use a line with this element in the reverse direction.

   A better way to do an equivalent thing in most cases is to use SOL. Unlike COORD, SOL automatically determines the parameters fo
r the coordinate transformation.

MARK</A>
</H3>
<PRE>MARK elements play special roles in FFS:	

(1) The first element of the beam line must be a MARK element to be used by FFS. In this case the MARK element contains the paramet
ers of the incoming beam (see optical-functions, special-variables EMITX, EMITY, DP). 
(2) The calculated optical parameters at a MARK command is saved by SAVE or STOP commands, then it can be used as the incoming cond
ition of other beam lines which have the same MARK element.	

Example: MARK P1 = (EMITX = .. EMITY = .. DP = ..);
         LINE  A = ( .. P1 ..)
               B = (P1 .. );
         FFS USE = A;
             ...           do matching on LINE A
             SAVE P1       save the parameters at P1
             USE B;        switch to LINE B
             ...           do matching of LINE B whose entrance is to be
                           matched P1.	

(3) If a MARK element has keyword GEO nonzero, this MARK element becomes the origin of the geometric rotation after the last SOL el
ement.
(4) The values of optical-functions of the MARK element at the beginning of the beam line can be specified as matching variables by
 the FREE command.	

 A MARK elements have all optical-functions as its keywords except NX, NY, TRX, TRY, and LENG. Also it has keywords EMITX, EMITY, a
nd DP which give the values of the corresponding special-variables.

OFFSET</A>
</H3>
<PRE>OFFSET is a relative position from the current position. A fraction is allowed to specify a location within an element.
   If the MARK at the beginning of a beam line has OFFSET nonzero, the optics calculation starts from the shifted location. If the 
last component of a beam line is a MARK with nonzero OFFSET, the optics calculation stops at the shifted location. The periodic con
dition is applied between those shifted locations.
   The geometric origin and the origin of LENG shift to the first MARK.

Examples:
(1)  LINE A    = ( ...  QF PQFC  ... );
     QUAD QF   = (L=0.3 K1=0.2);
     MARK PQFC = (OFFSET = -0.5);

Here PQFC represents the center of QF.

(2)  LINE A    = ( ...  PQFC QF  ... );

     QUAD QF   = (L=0.3 K1=0.2);
     MARK PQFC = (OFFSET =  1.5);
Here PQFC represents the center of QF, too (consider why). The value of OFFSET is interpreted taking the direction of the LINE into
 account, i.e., a MARK in a line A represents the same location in a line -A.

Restrictions:
(1) The outputs by DISPLAY(DISP) outside of the narrowed region by OFFSET are
    meaningless.

   In a SOL region, the coordinate is shifted on the axis of the solenoid, no matter how the design orbit bends there. The x-direct
ion of the coordinate in a solenoid is so chosen as to CHI3 = 0. At the exit of a solenoid, the coordinate is shifted back to the d
esign orbit, but the value of CHI3 is so determined as to set CHI3 zero at the nearest MARK element which has GEO = 1 after the exi
t. The offset and orientation of the design orbit can be given by keywords DX, DY, DPX, DPY at a SOL element with GEO = 1. SOL can 
be used to shift the coordinate to the actual orbit even without BZ. It is useful to define the coordinate with magnets with DX and

</PRE>
<H3><A NAME=L296>
EMITTANCE(EMIT)</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: (1) EMIT
       (2) EMIT dp

(1) EMIT calculates the closed orbit, the normal coordinate, and the equilibrium emittance assuming the current beam line is a posi
tron ring. One of EMITTANCE(EMIT), the Emittance[] function, or the EMIT command in the MAIN level are necessary to be done in prio
r to multi-turn tracking. See multi-turn-tracking.

(2) EMIT dp, where dp is |df_rf/f_rf|/(alpha_p == momentum compaction), does EMIT for five rf frequencies:

EquAlign["\\frac{1}{\\alpha_p}\\frac{\\varDelta f_{\\rm rf}}{f_{\\rm rf}}=-|{\\tt DP}|, -|{\\tt DP}|/2, 0, |{\\tt DP}|/2, |{\\tt DP
}|\\,,","   df_rf/f_rf/alpha_p = -|dp|, -|dp|/2, 0, |dp|/2, |dp|,"]

then prints out a table of the dependences of various quantities on the frequency shift.

   The results of EMITTANCE(EMIT) are affected by flags COD, RADCOD, RFSW, INTRA, WSPAC, EMIOUT, CODPLOT and special-variables MOME
NTUM, CHARGE, FSHIFT, MINCOUP, PBUNCH. The flag TRPT or RING affects only Emittance[], as EMITTANCE(EMIT) automatically set RING.

   EMITTANCE(EMIT) returns the equilibrium emittances in variables EMITX, EMITY, EMITZ, and the equilibrium bunch length in SIGZ, t
he relative momentum spread in SIGE, and the longitudinal equilibrium position DTSYNCH. Values Max[EMITk, MINCOUP*(EMITX+EMITY)] (k
=X,Y) are used in the intrabeam calculaton, but variables EMITX and EMITY hold the original value without MINCOUP.

   The map used in EMIT is slightly different from that used in the tracking. For instance, the edge angle of a bend is approximate
d by a thin quad. If the edge angle is large and the curvature is small, EMIT may give a wrong answer. This will be corrected in ne
ar future.

Fit</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: Fit[data, expr, var, 
         {par1, ini1, [{min1, max1}] }, .. ,{parn, inin, [{minn, maxn}]},
         [options..] ]

performs a nonlinear fitting of data with an expression expr.

data: list of {xi,yi}, {xi,yi,dyi}, or {xi,yi,dxi,dyi}, where dxi and dyi
      are the standard deviation of the i-th point.
expr: an expression containing var as the x-variable, and 
      parameters par1,..,parn explicitly. Use Evaluate[fun] if an implicit
      expression is necessary.
var:  a symbol to express the x-axis variable.
par:  parameter symbol to be varied in the fitting.
ini:  initial value of the parameter. It must be specified.
(min, max}: optional range of parameter.

Fit returns the result as a list:

{par1 -> v1, .., parn->vn, ChiSquare -> chisq, GoodnessOfFit -> good,
ConfidenceInterval -> {c1, .., cn}, ConvarianceMatrix -> cov},

where v1,..,vn are the values of the parameters which minimizes chi-square, chisq is the resulting minimum value of the total chi-s
quare (when no error is given for yi, variance is returned), good is a number given by GammaRegularized[(ndata-npara)/2,chisq/2] to
 represent the goodness of the fit, c1, .., cn are the estimated errors in parameters, and cov is the covariance matrix. A typical 
criterion of the goodness is (good > 0.1).

   Options are

MaxIterations        Maximum number of iterations.
D                    If True (default), tries to use analytical derivative.
Cutoff               If nonzero, set the saturation point for each data as:

chi-suare = Sum_i ( Min[Cutoff, Max[-Cutoff, (d_i - f_ i) / sigma_i]]^2 ) ,

                     which is a sort of robust M-Estimates. By Cutoff, the fit
                     tends to ignore tail data which are beyond Cutoff.
                     If Cutoff is zero (default), it is ignored.

where list contains data in the form as {{x1,y1}, ..} or {{x1,{y11, y12, ..}}, ..}.
 Complex number can be allowed for y, but not for x.

 This spline assumes y''=0 at the boundary, unless Derivative->{dy1,dy2} is specified to constrain the derivative at each end to dy
1 or dy2. They can be Null to unspecify the constraint at one of the boundary. The resulting data of the spline is assigned sp as a
 SplineData object. Then one can calculate the interpolated data by

    sp[x]                     value of y at x.
    Derivative[1][sp][x]      value of y' at x.
    Derivative[2][sp][x]      value of y'' at x.
    Integrate[sp[x],{x, x0, x1}]   integral of sp[x] from x0 to x1.

DownhillSimplex</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage: DownhillSimplex[initial, f, options]

minimizes a function f by the downhill simplex method, starting from an initial simplex initial.  Suppose f is a function of n vari
ables.   Then  initial is a list of n+1 elements, each of which is a list of the form

   {f[vi], vi} ,

where vi is a list of n values corresponding to each variable. The initial must be sorted in ascending order of f, i.e.,

   initial=Sort[Map[{f[#],#}&,vlist]]

generates initial from a list of variables vlist.
   DownhillSimplex returns the final simplex in the same form as initial.

Options:
   VariableRange -> {{min1 .. minn}, {max1 .. maxn}} gives the range of n
      variables.   The default is -Infinity to Infinity for all variables.
   MaxIteration -> maxi gives the limit of number of iterations.   The
      default is Max[100, 10*(n+1)].
   Output -> lfn sets the output file number for the intermediate results.
      the default is 6 (stdout).
   Tolerance -> tol sets the tolerance to judge the local minimum.
      If (fmax-fmin)/(abs(fmax)+abs(fmin)) becomes less than tol, the 
      iteration loop terminates.   The default is 10^-6.

Examples:
  f:=Apply[Function[{x,y},((x^2+y^2)-1)*(x^2+y^2)-(x-.5)/3.],#]&;
  v={{1.,1.},{0.,-1.},{0.,1.}};

       yrange: {ymin, ymax},
       zrange: {zmin, zmax},
       and for the horizontal plane, specified by the Axes option, 
       the corresponding range must be given as {v1, ..., vn}.
       These values are the initial amplitude divided by the equilibrium 
       values, i.e., Sqrt[2Jx,y/(EMITX+EMITY)], Sqrt[2Jz/EMITZ].
       See EMITTANCE(EMIT) command or Emittance function.
nturn: number of turns to track.
options: Output->lfn : output to the unit lfn (see OpenWrite).
         Axes->axes : one of "XY", "XZ", "YX", "YZ", "ZX", "ZY",
          where the first character specifies the horizontal axis, and
          the second the vertical, respectively. The default is "ZX".
         ReferenceOrbit->{x0, px0, y0, py0, z0, dp0} : Survey is done around
          this orbit.
         PhaseX->phix : The initial amplitude is rotated in (X, PX) phase space
          by phix. Default is zero.
         PhaseY->phiy : The initial amplitude is rotated in (Y, PY) phase space
          by phiy. Default is zero.
         PhaseZ->phiz : The initial amplitude is rotated in (Z, PZ) phase space
          by phiz. Default is -Pi/2.
         ExpandElementValues->True(default) : set the values of the components
          according to the values of elements. Machine errors may be reset.
          See machine-error-commands, CALCULATE(CALC).

   DynamicApertureSurvey returns the result as a list:

   {score,{{{xmin, xmax},{ymin, ymax},{z1, z2, .., zn}},
           {{z1,score1,{turn1_1,..,turn1_50}},..,
            {zn,scoren,{turnn_1,..,turnn_50}}}}} ,

where score = Sum[scorei,{i,n}], scorei is the "score" of i-th momentum, and turni_j is the lost turn of the particle with i-th mom
entum and j-th initial amplitude.
   DynamicApertureSurvey tracks number of particles with different initial conditions in the range given by range. It outputs a z-x
 diagram of the dynamic aperture of the ring. Fifty one initial conditions are chosen in the range x-range for each point of z-rang
e. The initial y-amplitude is linearly dependent on the x-amplitude. It tracks from xmax to downward for each z-amplitude zn, until
 the particles turns nturn with successive DAPWIDTH x-amplitudes. The default DAPWIDTH is 7.

   If the second argument is omitted, it means all elements.
   The element-position can be known by Element["POSITION"].
   Key-strings "VALUE" and element-keywords allows to be set (i.e., Element[a,b] = v) when element-pattern-string chooses only one

IntrabeamExcitation     List of the change of the 6 x 6 beam matrix due to the intrabeam scattering (only when INTRA), converted to
 the beginning of the beam line.	

   If the flag TRPT or NORING is set, the calculation assumes a transport line so that several quantities such as damping rate, eig
en modes, equilibrium beam matrix, etc. are meaningless. Use RING or NOTRPT for such calculation. In the case of TRPT or NORING, th
e incoming beam envelope must be given by the option InitialBeamMatrix with a 6 x 6 symmetric matrix. TRPT is useful for calculatio
n of space charge and intrabeam in a transport line.
   Please do not forget to put semicolon at the end of Emittance[] function, otherwise the output will be huge especially when Orbi
t or Matrix is True.
 If ExpandElementValues->False, calculation is made using the present values of each component (i.e., including machine errors).

If SaveEMIT->True, the calculated values of emittances are stored in variables EMITX, EMITY, EMITZ, SIGE, SIGZ. The default is Save
EMIT->False. These are the values calculated by the lattice, and not affected by MINCOUP.

InitialOrbit->{x0,px0,y0,py0,z0,dp0/p0} specifies the incoming orbit which is valid when NOCOD is set. The option Output->filenum e

ExternalMap</A>
</H3>
<PRE>With MAP elements, ExternalMap defines a user-defined map of particles. It also allows a user to do anything (doing statistics
, etc.) at any point of a beam line during a tracking. 

Usage: First define a MAP element at MAIN level:

     MAP    name=(L=leng);

Currently L is the only keyword. Insert it at the location(s) where you want to use it.

1) Tracking
In FFS, define the function ExternalMap as

    ExternalMap["TRACK",n,nt_,x_]:=body;

The second argument n is the position of MAP counting from the beginning, which can be obtained using LINE["POSITION","name.m"]. Th
e third argument nt_ is used to receive the number of turns which is incremented by the tracking. The last argument x_ is used to r
eceive the coordinates of particles. It is a (7 or 9, np) list of real numbers. The elements  (1..8, i) are (x, px ,y ,py ,z ,dp/p0
, sy, sarg) of the i-th particle. The (-1, i)  element is True(==1) if the i-th particle has been survived, and False(==0) if it ha
s been lost. The spin coordinates sy and sarg are only valid with the POL flag.

 You can define ExternalMap to change the coordinates of each particle as you like by returning a new x in the same format as above
. If you do not return it or you return in a different format, the tracking routine does not change the particle coordinates. You c
an neither rebirth a lost particle nor kill a surviving particle.

After defined ExternalMap, tracking calls it in every turn.

Example:

   MAP P1=();
   ....
   LINE A=(... P1 ... P1 ...);
   ....
   FFS USE=A;
     ExternalMap["TRACK",LINE["POSITION","P1.2"],nt_,x_]:=
       (Print[x];x*2);
   ....

   TRACK USE=A ....;

This example defines ExternalMap to print out the coordinates of all particles at the second P1 in the line A. It also makes all co
ordinates of all particles twice in every turn.

   Optionally a compiled module CompiledMap can be used for ExternalMap["TRACK"] (see below).

2) Emittance
In FFS, define the function ExternalMap as

   ExternalMap["EMIT",n,cod_]:=body;

The second argument n is the position of MAP counting from the beginning, which can be obtained using LINE["POSITION","name.m"]. Th
e last argument cod_ is used to receive the orbit at the entrance of the element, as a list of 6 real numbers. ExternalMap must ret
urn a list, either {cod1, trans} or  {cod1, trans, dtrans, dbeam}, where cod1 is the orbit at the exit, trans is the 6 by 6 transfe
r matrix of this element, dtrans is the radiation damping part of the transfer matrix (6 by 6), and dbeam is the radiation excitati
on of the beam matrix (6 by 6). Only j >= i parts of dbeam[[i, j]] are taken into account.

Example:

   ExternalMap["EMIT",LINE["POSITION","P1"],cod_]:=(
     Print[cod];
     {cod+{0,0.001,0,0,0,0},IdentityMatrix[6]});

3) Optics
In FFS, define the function ExternalMap as

   ExternalMap["OPTICS",n,cod_]:=body;

The second argument n is the position of MAP counting from the beginning, which can be obtained using LINE["POSITION","name.m"]. Th
e last argument cod_ is used to receive the orbit at the entrance of the element, as a list of 6 real numbers. ExternalMap must ret
urn a list {cod1, trans}, where cod1 is the orbit at the exit and trans is the 6 by 6 transfer matrix of this element. In the case 
of CACL4D (== ~CALC6D), only the 4 by 5 transfer matrix is effective.

Example:

   ExternalMap["OPTICS",LINE["POSITION","P1"],cod_]:=(
     Print[cod];
     {cod+{0,0.001,0,0,0,0},IdentityMatrix[6]});

4) Geometry
In FFS, define the function ExternalMap as

   ExternalMap["GEO",n,geo_,pos_]:=body;

The second argument n is the position of MAP counting from the beginning, which can be obtained using LINE["POSITION","name.m"]. Th
e argument geo_ receives the geometry of the beam line at the MAP element, in the same format as LINE["GEO",n], i.e., {{GX,GY,GZ},{
CHI1,CHI2,CHI3}}. The last argument pos_ receives the orbit length S at the element. ExternalMap must return an updated list {geo1,
 pos1}, as { {{GX,GY,GZ},{CHI1,CHI2,CHI3}}, S} as the values at the exit of the element.

Example:

   ExternalMap["GEO",LINE["POSITION","P1"],geo_,pos_]:=(
     Print[cod];
     { {geo[[1]]+{1,0,0}, geo[[2]]}, pos+0.1})

CompiledMap</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage:

ExternapMa["TRACK", n, nt_, x_]:=CompiledMap[nt, x, src, prm, opt___];

where n is the location number, nt the number of turns, x the particle coordinates with the alive flag, as described for ExternalMa
p. It takes options of Rules as shown below. A charachter string src is the source code for the map, which completes a subroutine h
aving a header:

implicit none;
integer,intent(in):: np,nprm,nt,n;
real(kind=8),intent(inout):: x(np),px(np),y(np),py(np),z(np),dp(np),&
                             sy(np),sarg(np),flag(np),prm(nprm);

where np is the number of particles, and prm is a list of reals of any length. The spin coordinates sy and sarg are meaningless wit
hout the flag POL. The src must ends with "return;end" to complete the subroutine, and more routines can be inserted if needed. Cur
rently gfortran in free format is available for the compiler, and gcc will be supported in future.

Example:

src = "flag = flag * merge(1.d0, 0.d0, x&ltprm(1) .or. x&gtprm(2) .or. (y&gtprm(3) .and. y&ltprm(4)));return;end";
prm = {-0.001, 0.001, -3e-4, 3e-4};
ExternalMap["TRACK", LINE["POSITION","M1.2"], nt_, x_]:=CompiledMap[nt, x, src, prm];

works as a special colimation at a MAP element M1.2, resulting:

<Collimate.png

(Actually the example above can be performed also by SADScript:

ExternalMap["TRACK", LINE["POSITION","M1.2"], nt_, x_]:=Append[Drop[x, -1],
       x[[1]] < prm[[1]] || x[[1]] > prm[[2]] || (prm[[3]] < x[[3]] < prm[[4]])];

which runs even FASTER than the compiled one!!)

Options      Defaul     Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
Single       False      If True, the map is called once for the entrire particles even for NPARA > 1.
Completion   Null       A completion SADScript to be called after the map with the arg {x, prm}.

<PRE>Usage:

(1) FitValue[component, function, {id_,dp_}, goal_, now_] := body

modifies the goal of the matching of function at component. The argument id_ is the orbit id for MatchingAmplitude or InitialOrbits
. The argument dp_ receives the value of dp/p0. The argument goal_ is the value of the goal of the matching set by matching-functio
n-commands. The argument now_ is the current value of function.

Example: FitValue["$$$", "NX", {_,dp_}, goal_, now_] := goal + dp * xix * 2 * Pi

sets the tune NX to have chromaticity xix.

(2) FitValue[component1, component2, function, {id_,dp_}, goal_, now1_, now2_] := body

modifies the value of the function at component1 for a two-component matching. Component1 is assumed upstream in the beam line. The
 value of body is used in place of the current value, now1. The argument id_ is the orbit id for MatchingAmplitude or InitialOrbits
. The argument dp_ receives the value of dp/p0. The argument goal_ is the value of the goal of the matching set by matching-functio
n-commands. The argument now1 and now2 are the current values of the function at component1 and component2, respectively.

Example: FitValue["QF1", "QF2", "NX", _, goal_, now1_, now2_] := 
   If[Abs[now2-(now1+goal)] < 0.01*2*Pi , Null, now1]

sets the tune difference between QF1 and QF2 gaol +- 0.01.

   During the matching process the matching routine calls FitValue with arguments, then if body returns a number, it overrides the 
goal give by matching-function-commands. If body returns Null, the matching of function is ignored.
   The matching-function-command is necessary besides FitValue to perform the matching. Only defining FitValue does not do the matc
hing.
   FitValue is cleared by USE. It is hidden by VISIT and restored by BYE

<PRE>To calculate the field of the synchrotron radiation from particles, first record trajectories of particles. This is done by th
e function TrackParticles with a new flag RADLIGHT on. When RADLIGHT is on, TrackParticles returns a list

   {beam, trajectory} ,

where beam is a list as {location, coordinates}, and trajectory is a list

   { {t1 .. tm}, {x1 ..xm}, {y1 .. ym}, {z1 .. zm} }, ..

where {t,x,y,z}_i is the coordinates of the particle at i-th point in the trajectory. The origin and the direction of the spatial c
oordinates are the same as GEO coordinate {GX, GY, GZ}. One can track many particles at the same time by TrackParticles, so the tra
jectory has the dimensions {np, m}, where np is the number of particles.

   After the trajectory is obtained, one can calculate the field in time domain
at any observation point. This is done by the function RadiationFiled as

   field = RadiationField[ trajectory[[i]], obs];

where trajectory[[i]] is the trajectory of the i-th particle, and obs is the spatial coordinate of the observation point in the GEO
 coordinate. The output field is a list

   { {tau1 .. taum},
     {Ex1 .. Exm}, {Ey1 .. Eym}, {Ez1 .. Ezm},
     {Hx1 .. Hxm}, {Hy1 .. Hym}, {Hz1 .. Hzm},
     {Sx1 .. Sxm}, {Sy1 .. Sym}, {Sz1 .. Hzm} }

where H = (n x E)/(c mu0) and S = E x H , and tau is the observation time.
   RadiationField uses the Feynmann-Heviside formula

   E = (mu0 e*CHARGE/4pi) (c^2n/R^2 + R/c d(c^2n/R^2)/dt + d^2n/dt^2) ,
 where n and R are the direction vector and the distance from the electron at the retarded time to an observation point. 
   The derivatives in the above formula is calculated using the spline
interpolation.

   Next one can calculate the spectrum of the field by RadiationSpectrum as

   spect = RadiationSpectrum[ {field[[1]], field[[k]]},
        {lambda1, lambda2, dlambda} ] ,

where filed[[k]] is one of the fields calculated by RadiationField. The range of the wavelength is given as a list above. The outpu

<PRE>TrackParticles[beam, destination-component, nbegin, nend]

returns a beam after the tracking at the entrance of the destination- component. The destination can be specified by the name of th
e component or by a number obtained by LINE["POSITION", component]. If destination is omitted, the end of the line is assumed.

The argument nbegin is the initial turn number to be passed to tracking to indicate it is in the n-th turn. The number is increased
 by 1 when it passes the end of beam line. If nbegin is omitted, 1 is assumed.

The argument nend is the last turn number. The default is nbegin.

   The variable beam and also the result of TrackParticles are lists of the form 

   {location, coordinates}

where location is the position-number of the starting point. If location is same as or in the downstream of destination, the tracki
ng is done by folding across the beginning of the beam line. The coordinates are in a list of {7 or 9, np} form, where np is the nu
mber of particles. The first 6 or 8 elements of coordinates specifie either

   {x, px/p0, y, py/p0, z, dp/p0} (NOPOL)
   {x, px/p0, y, py/p0, z, dp/p0, sarg, sy} (POL)

in this order, depending on POL. The row [[-1, i]] is the alive flag which is True (==1) when the particle is alive, and False (==0
) when lost.

   If the flag POL is on, TrackParticles performs spin tracking. Then the coordinates has two more components sy and sarg, which co
rrespond to the y-component of the classical spin vector and the angle ArcTan[sx, sz], respectively. If POL is on, another flag RAD
POL turns on the Sokolov-Ternov effect.

   When a flag RADLIGHT is on, TrackParticles returns the trajectories of particles which are used to calculate the radiation field
s. See RadiationField and RadiationSpectrum.

When PHOTONS is ON (default is OFF), TrackParticles generates a list of all photons radiated through the tracking. The list is assi
gned to a symbol PhotonList.

When LOSSMAP is ON (default is OFF), the input list must have two more lines resulting in a shape of {9 or 11, np}. Then TrackParti
cles returns into these lines the component and the turn where the loss of each particle is detected.

TransferMatrix</A>
</H3>
<PRE>TransferMatrix[from_, to_, options___] returns the 4x4 or 6x6 transfer matrix (TM) from component 'from' to component 'to', de
pending on the flag CALC4D or CALC6D, respectively. Locations from and to can be the name or the component number. If to < from, th
e inverse Matrix of TM[to, from] is returned, If Fold option is False (default).  Possible options are:

Options           Default      Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
Fold              False        If True && to < from, returns TM[1, to].TM(from,-1] .
Symplectic        False        If True, returns the symplectic matrix considering acceleration.
Calc6D            False        If True, returns 6x6 TM even under CALC4D.

Twiss</A>
</H3>
<PRE> Twiss[optical-function, component] returns the value of the optical-function at the entrance of component. The values are tho
se calculated by the last CALCULATE(CALC) or GO commands, or CalculateOptics function.
 The second argument, component can be a name of component, a component number, or a list of them. If the number has a fraction, th
e intermediate value in the component is calculated.
 Twiss["ALL",component] or Twiss["*",component] returns all 28 optical-functions at the entrance of component as a list:

{AX, BX, GMX, NX, AY, BY, GMY, NY, EX, EPX, EY, EPY, R1, R2, R3, R4, DETR, DX, DPX, DY, DPY, DZ, DDP, AZ, BZ, GMZ, NZ, ZX, ZPX, ZY,
 ZPY},

which can be directly used in CalculateOptics. In the current version, however, parameters after AZ are uninteresting, because it a
lways returns 1 for BZ and zeros for the others. "R"//optical-function refers the reference optics. "D"//optical-function refers th
e difference between the current and the referece optics. "RALL" and "DAL" mean the all optical functions for the reference optics 
and the differences, respectively.
   Keywords "PEX", "PEPX", "PEY", "PEPY", "PZX", "PZPX", "PZY", "PZPY" return dispersions in the physical coordinate.
   Keywords "BMAGX", "BMAGY", "BMAGZ" return the BMAG coefficients againt the reference-optics set by the REFERENCE(REF) command.
   Keywords "LENGTH", "GAMMA", "GAMMABETA", "S", "SIGab" return the same results as for the function LINE.
   The units of NX, NY, NZ are in radian.

VariableRange</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage:   VariableRange[element, keyword ,v_] := expression

where the current value of the element:keyword is passed in v_, and expression should give False when the value is out of range.

Example: VariableRange["QF","ROTATE",v_]:= -0.1 < v < 0.1;

This restricts the range of the rotation angle of QF within +-100 mrad.

         VariableRange[_,"ROTATE",v_]:= -0.1 < v < 0.1;

This specifies the same for all elements.
   The expression can also return the range as a list {vmin, vmax}, which may give more chance of solution-finding for the matching
 routine.
   VariableRange only acts for variables used in the matching with the FREE command.

<H3><A NAME=L417>
VariableWeight</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Usage:   VariableWeight[element, keyword ,v_] := expression

where the default weight for matching with element:keyword is passed in v_, and expression should return a modified value of weight
. If non-real is returned, the default weight is used.

Example: VariableWeight["QF","K1",v_]:= 0.1*v;

reduces the weight of QF1:K1 to 1/10 of the default value.

   The weight also affects the step size of the numerical derivative of the response. A smaller weight makes the step size larger.

   VariableWeight only acts for variables used in the matching with the FREE command.

<PRE>   WakeFunction[Longitudinal, comp]={{z1, wl1}, ..., {zn, wln}};
   WakeFunction[Transverse,   comp]={{z1, wt1}, ..., {zn, wtn}};

specify longitudinal and transverse dipole wake functions at a component comp (string). Each functions is a list of {z, w} where z 
is the distance and w is the value of the wake, in the unit of either V/C or V/C/m.
   The wake functions are applied at the component comp, giving kicks to each orbit whose initial conditions are given by InitialOr
bits. The sufficient number of orbits depends on the situation.
   WakeFunction is valid only when TRPT and INS, and also either TWAKE or LWAKE is ON.
   For tracking, it is only valid in TrackParticles.

Object-oriented-programing</A>
</H3>
<PRE>Environment for an object-oriented-programming is supplied by:

Class:          The function to define a class.
context:        A class defines a context to define its all symbols for
                the variables and methods within the context.
                This automatically avoids conflicts of symbols between 
                classes, Global, and System. When c = Class[ ... ] is
                done, a context c` is defined.

members:        The set of Members of a class is a union of class variables,
                instance variables, and class methods of the class.

operator @:     A special operator to access class member. In a notation 
                f@g, g's context defaults the class of the class of f. 
                f@g@h[x] is recognized as ((f@g)@h)[x] , thus the context of
                h defaults the class of f.

superclasses:   A class inherits all class variables, instance variables,
                class methods from its superclasses which are give by the
                first argument of Class. If a null list is given, Object` 
                is set as the default superclass. Multiple inheritance is
                allowed.

class variable: Class variables are given by the second argument of Class
                as a list of symbols. They are unique in the class.
                They can be initialized by declaring in a way such as 
                {a=1, {b, c} = {2, 3}} like Module. A form like
                {a = b = c =1} is allowed.

instance variable: 
                Instance variables are given by the third argument of Class
                as a list of symbols. An instance has those symbols
                separately. They can be initialized by declaring in a way
                such as {a=1, {b, c} = {2, 3}} like as Module. A form like as
                {a = b = c =1} is allowed. Also they
                are initialized at the creation of instance by rules as
                x = c[ a->1, b:>Print[d]], etc.

class methods:  Class methods are given by the fourth(last) argument of
                Class. They must be in the form of either one of

                f_[arg___] := g_;
                With[_, f_[arg___] := g_];
                With[_, f_[arg___] := g_; .. ];
                If[_,
                  ft_[argt___] := gt_; ..,
                  ft_[argf___] := gf_; ..,];
                h_[f_[arg___], b___] ^:= g_; .

                where f is the symbol for the method to be defined.
                Set may be used instead of SetDelayed if necessary.

This:           A symbol This in the definition of the method, it is 
                translated to the object (the instance or the class) which 
                refers the member.

default reference:
                In the definition of the class methods, whenever a member of
                the class is appeared, it is recognized as This@member.
                When a symbol of the member conflicts the symbol in System`,
                the system symbol should be wrapped by Literal.

reference of member of superclasses:
                Members of the superclasses (denote cc) are referred by 
                cc`member in the definition of the method.

copying an instance:
                An instance c of a class can be copied to another symbol
                by c1 = c. After the copying, c1 and c refer the identical
                instance. Destructing one of them by such as c1=. clears
                the instance and also all the assigned symbols.

Constructor:    When an instance is defined, by x = c[arg], a method
                x@Constructor[arg] is always invoked.
                In evaluation of instance definition under class scope,
                class member symbol appeared 1st slot of Rule or RuleDelayed
                argument is sent to Constructor of new class instance
                without evaluation. (In other term, class member symbol on
                1st slot of Rule or RuleDelayed argument behaves like
                evaluating with implicit Literal[]) One can configure
                Constructor[] in the definition of the class.
                x = c[arg] returns the returned value of Constructor[arg].
                The rules in the argument work in two ways: (1) A rule for an
                instance variable or a class variable sets the initial value
                of the variable, (2) Other rules are stored in an instance
                variable Options as a list.

Destructor:     An instance x is cleared by (x=.), which invokes 
                x@Destructor[]. The default Destructor is Object`Destructor,
                but one can reconfigure it in the definition of the class.

Short:          When an instance x is returned as the result of expression
                for Out[], x@Short[] is invoked to show the result. The 
                default Short is Object`Short, but one can reconfigure it
                in the definition of the class.

other methods:  Class[] gives the class of the instance.
                Parents[] gives the immediate superclasses.
                AllParents[] gives the all superclasses.
                Members[] gives a list of class variables, class methods,
                and instance variables of the class.
                AllMembers[] gives a list of class variables, class methods,

   If two components are given, it means a relative-fitting or zone-fitting. If the fitting condition is not maximum-fitting, the c
ondition means to make values at two components equal (for AX, BX, GMX, AY, BY, GMY, EX, EPX, EY, EPY, R1, R2, R3, R4, DX, DPX, DY,
 DPY, PEX, PEPX, PEY, PEPY, CHI1, CHI2, CHI3),  or have the specified difference (for NX, NY, LENG, GX, GY, GZ). If the fitting con

DPX, DY, DPY, PEX, PEPX, PEY, PEPY, CHI1, CHI2, CHI3), which suppress the maximum of the function in the region between component1

       (2) matching-functionM goal-value [off-momentum-points]
       (3) matching-functionI incoming-value
       (4) matching-functionSCALE scale

(1) sets the matching condition for matching-function at the current fitting point or region with the goal-value and the off-moment
um-points (see off-momentum-matching).
   If off-momentum-points is omitted, the previous value for this matching-function at this fitting-point is assumed. If the previo
us value is not defined, 1 is assumed. If -1 is given for off-momentum-points, the matching-function is rejected from the matching 
(see REJECT(REJ)).
   If "*" is given for goal-value, the previous value is used if exists.

Example:   BX 10 3    (beta_x to be 10 at 3 momenta) 
           BX 20      (now beta_x to be 20 at 3 momenta (previous setting))
           BX *  5    (now beta_x to be 20 (previous setting) at 5 momenta)

(2) If the letter "M" is appended to matching-function, it means the maximum-fitting for the function. The maximum of either the va
lue (for positive-definite functions) or the absolute value (for bipolar functions) are to be limited in the matching.

(3) If SCALE is appended to matching-function, it sets the scale of the input/output of the function to scale. This scale is used i
n the matching-function commands, DISPLAY(DISP), SHOW, etc.

(4) If the current fit location is at a MARK, @ refers the saved value at the MARK. @- refers -(saved value), and @* refers (the or
ientation of MARK)*(saved value).  These are useful to match using the already-saved values, for instance to match between two beam
 lines having the common MARK.

off-momentum-matching</A>
</H3>
<PRE>FFS matches the optical functions for an orbit with finite momentum deviation.

Example: 
   DP=0.01;      sets the range of momentum to DP0-0.01 < dp/p0 < DP0+0.01 .
   BX 10 9;      sets the goal of betax to 10 m, at 9 points.
                 in the range above, i.e.,
                 dp/p0 = {-0.01,-0.0075,-0.005,-0.0025,0,
                          0.0025,0.005,0.0075,0.01} + DP0 .
   GO starts the matching.

As this example, the off-momentum points are chosen with equal separation. If the off-momentum point n is an even number, the chose
n points are same as the case of n+1, but the on-momentum point (==DP0) is excluded.
 If a list {min, max} is set to DP, the off-momentum matching is performed at dp/p(k) = min*Sin[k Pi/2/n], max*Sin[k Pi/2/n], {k,0,
fitp/2}, where fitp is the number of off-momentum points given by FITP.

, the range DP0 - DP < dp/p0 < DP0 + DP is used for the matching.
 If DP is set to a list {min, max}, the off-momentum matching is performed at dp/p= min*Sin[k Pi/2/n], max*Sin[k Pi/2/n], {k,0,fitp
/2}, where fitp is the number of off-momentum points given by FITP.
 The assumed momentum-distribution in the BEAMSIZE(BEAM), MEASURE(MEA), etc. commands, is Gaussian with the standard deviation DP a

Useage:  ElementValues = { key[elem] :> expr, ...}

where	

   key:      keyword to specify a value (string).
   elem:     String to specify the elements or components, wildcards are allowed.
   expr:     an expression which returs a real number to be set to the elements or components.	

Example:  ElementValues = 
            { "DX"["QF1"] :> "DX"["QD1"]-0.001,
              "DY"["QF2.3"] :> -"DY"["QD1.2"],

Remarks:
	
1. Iff elem contains ".", it is recognized as components, otherwise as elements.
2. In the r.h.s. of the rule, an expression like key[elem] is evaluated as either LINE[key, elem] or Element[key, elem], depending 
on elem has ".".
3. The expression expr can be any expression returning a real number.
4. Later rules overrides the former, if many rules apply on the same keyword of the same element.
5. The rule given by ElementValues overrides the relation given by COUP_LE command.
6. Use a[b] in stead of a@b.
7. ElementValues is cleared by USE. It is hidden by VISIT and restored by BYE.

FitFunction</A>
</H3>
<PRE>FitFunction is a symbol to assign user-defined functions for matching with the GO command. 

Usage:   FitFunction := fun, 

where fun is a function that returns a real number or a list of real numbers, to be matched to zero by GO. The goal of GO is to mak
e fun zero or a list of zeros, together with built-in matching conditions. Thus the sum of fun^2 is added to MatchingResidual. GO a
lso evaluates FitFunction to obtain the derivatives numerically. The function fun can refer the value of variables by Element or LI
NE functions, and the optical functions at DP0 by Twiss. The algorithm of matching is same as that for built-in conditions, but it 
is slower because of the numerical differentiation, when the beam line is long and the number of variables large.

Example:  FitFunction := {Twiss["BX","$$$"]-20, Twiss["BY","$$$"]-20};

which puts the same goal as

   FIT $$$ BX 20 BY 20 .

   FitFunction is cleared by USE. It is also hidden by VISIT and restored by BYE.

t from the central orbit. If six numbers are given, only the offsets of the orbits are affected. If 27 numbers are given, all Twiss
 parameters are set (values for non-orbit params are used directly. Orbits are giving offsets.)

MatchingAmplitude</A>
</H3>
<PRE>MatchingAmplitude is a list of amplitudes for the finite-amplitude matching.

Usage: MatchingAmplitude := { {dp1,x1,y1}, ..};

where dp1 is the momentum deviation to be matched, x1 and y1 are the horizontal and vertical amplitudes at the beginning of the bea
m line, normalized by Sqrt of the sum of the emittance, i.e., Sqrt[(EMITX+EMITY)]. Three orbits are chosen in each dimension. The i
nitial conditions of the orbit is chosen as

   {X,Px,Y,Py} =
   { {x1,0,0,0}, {-x1/2,Sqrt[3]/2 x1,0,0}, {-x1/2,-Sqrt[3]/2 x1,0,0},
     {0,0,y1,0}, {0,0,-y1/2,Sqrt[3]/2 y1}, {0,0,-y1/2,Sqrt[3]/2 y1} },

and when x1==0 or y1==0 corresponding orbits are excluded. The above are labeled {x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3} in the output of CALCULATE(CAL
) or GO, and also labeled 1 to 6 in the second element of FFS["CALC"] and FFS["GO"].

    This matching is done when dp1 is within the off-momentum range given by DP, i.e., Abs[dp1] < DP. If dp1 is in the range, the n
earest zero- amplitude optics is chosen. The maching conditions for the finite- amplitude optics are same as those for the zero-amp
litude one.
   Th orbit with finte initial condition never close after one revolution, but FFS simply ignores it and obtain the periodic optics
 around the open
orbit.

MatchingResidual</A>
</H3>
<PRE>MatchingResidual holds the convergence in the last GO or CALCULATE(CAL) commands. It is calculated by

     sw*(Sum[(w_i*df_i)^ExponentOfResidual,{i}]/sw)^(2/ExponentOfResidual)
     +penalty
 where w_i is the weight of the i-th condition, df_i is the difference of the i-th function from the goal, penalty is an additional
 big number  (typically 10), when the optics is unstable or closed orbit is not found in the case of CELL. The parameter sw is defi
ned as

     sw=Sum[(OffMomentumWeight/2/woff)^2,{i}]
 with

     woff = 1                               for on-momentum optics
          = Sqrt[number-of-momentum-points] for off-momentum optics.
 The weight of the function is lighter in the case of off-momentum-matching so that all off-momentum deviations functions weight eq
ual to the on-momentum one. However, the relative weight for the off-momentum part can be changed by setting OffMomentumWeight. 
   The weight of each function at each point with each momentum can be specified by defining the FitWeight function.

PhotonList</A>
</H3>
<PRE>When PHOTONS is ON (default is OFF), with RAD and FLUC, TrackParticles generates a list of all photons radiated through the tr
acking. The list is assigned to a symbol PhotonList. PhotonList is a list of

{en, gx, gy, gz, nx, ny, nz, xi1, xi2, xi3, np, nele}

where

en:    photon energy [eV]
gx:    GX coordinate of the emission point [m]
gy:    GY coordinate of the emission point [m]
gz:    GZ coordinate of the emission point [m]
nx:    GX component of the photon direction vector
ny:    GY component of the photon direction vector
nz:    GZ component of the photon direction vector (nx^2+ny^2+nz^2)=1.
xi1:   Stokes' parameter for polarization 45 degree to the GZ=0 plane.
xi2:   Stokes' parameter for right-handed polarization
xi3:   Stokes' parameter for polarization in the GZ=0 plane.
np:    particle number
nele:  component number in the beam line

The probability of each polarization is given by each Stokes' parameter as (1+xi)/2 . TrackParticles always updates PhotonList. The
 length of PhtonList is the number of emitted photons.
   Remember that the {GX, GY, GZ} = {0, 0, 0} and their directions are {z, -x, -y} at the entrance of the beam line by default. It 
is changeable by the GEO command anyway.
